How to Play Quarto

Quarto is a strategic two-player board game. The goal is to form a line of four pieces sharing at least one attribute (size, color, shape, or hollowness). Players take turns selecting a piece for their opponent to place on the board. The game is a blend of strategy and deduction.

For detailed rules and strategies, refer to the official Quarto rules.
